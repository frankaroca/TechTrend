## Objective

From scratch, create a fully-functional, responsive website that will allow for users to register a new account, and be able to login, where their information is stored inside a database. Once they have either created a new account or successfully logged in, they will be granted the option to be able to create a new post that can be shared in a global landing page (even displayed for users currently logged off). They will be able to include a title and a description to be included in their post, where the date posted will be shown in the post, including the name of the user. As long as the user is currently logged into the session, he/she will also have a dashboard page in which the person will be able to see all of their posts, and be able to update/delete any post. If updated/deleted, the post will be immediately updated in both the landing page and the dashboard page. Lastly, if the user wishes to log out, they will be able to do so by clicking on a 'logout' button that will terminate their current session, and be taken back into the landing page, where they will be given the option to log back in.
